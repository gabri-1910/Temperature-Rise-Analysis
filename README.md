# Data analysis on temperature rise in São Félix do Xingu
This is my first Data Science project, using real data from a variety of sources and with results that can be used in the real world. In this project, the idea is to analyze temperature, rainfall and flow rate data from the river that cuts through the city to answer the following questions: Have temperatures increased? Did this affect the level of rainfall and the flow of the River?

THE PROJECT HAS THREE PARTS:

  The first:
    It was build on historical data from the INMET (National Institute of Meteorology) Weather Station.
    Here we analyze the Temperature Data, from cleaning to final analyzis.
    
  The Second:
    From INMET data, it is also possible to obtain information on the daily rainfall level recorded in millimeters.
    
  The Third:
    Using the Open Data of the National Water Agency (ANA), it was possible to get the flow rate level of the Xingu River.
    
After analyzing these three sets of data, we can draw some conclusions.
